high-level todos:
 - complete dreamer and world-models model learning today



todos:
 - generate samples
 - 



future todos:
 - compare parameters in dreamer and world-models.. should be roughly the same
 - how to do hyperparameter search.. tune?
 - change sampling procedure to same as supervised learning.. sample from shuffled data IDs:
    - training loop can probably done in terms of epochs, as dataset is finite
